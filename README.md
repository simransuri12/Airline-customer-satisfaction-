# Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes airline customer satisfaction data to understand key factors influencing passenger experience, loyalty, and service quality, with a primary focus on premium (business-class) travelers. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help airlines improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset (Kaggle – Japan Airlines survey)
- **Size:** 25,893 rows and 25 variables after data cleaning
- **Key Features:**  
  Passenger demographics, travel class, flight distance, customer type, loyalty status, and satisfaction ratings across multiple airline services.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Tableau:** Exploratory analysis and dashboard visualization  
- **CSV:** Cleaned dataset used for analysis

## Data Preparation
- Removed missing values and inconsistencies
- Verified categorical variables and numerical ranges
- Final cleaned dataset: `Clean_PassengerSatisfaction.csv`

## Analysis & Visualizations
The project includes multiple visualizations to explore passenger behavior and satisfaction:
- Passenger distribution by travel class
- Passenger count by flight distance and class
- Business-class satisfaction breakdown
- Loyalty and age distribution among business-class passengers
- Likert-scale analysis of service satisfaction (before-flight and in-flight services)

## Key Insights

- A significant portion of premium passengers report neutral or dissatisfied experiences
- Middle-aged passengers show higher loyalty levels
- Ease of online booking and in-flight WiFi are major areas for improvement

## Objective
To provide data-driven insights that airlines can use to:
- Improve premium passenger experience
- Enhance service quality
- Strengthen customer loyalty
- Support targeted marketing and operational decisions

## Future Work
